<p><small>Old description: These aren't reviews, they are my thoughts I put together about the cartoons.</small></p>
<p>Hi there, this page contains a list of cartoons 
that I enjoyed over time and cartoons 
that I... didn't enjoy as much; it may also contain 
cartoons that I have yet to watch. 
Everyone watched at least a cartoon or something 
else at some point, mostly when they were 
kids, but that doesn't mean cartoons are only for kids! 
they're for everyone to enjoy (why do you think they're rated 7+, "for everyone" and more, and not "for kids only"), and I will still 
watch cartoons because no one should tell 
me what to do.<br>But, with that away, here you go</p>

<p>Used to watch this when I had nothing else to watch when I was little. Back 
then I had no idea what was going on, and with my forgetful brain (that didn't 
change a bit, BTW), I'd forget what happened the moment the cartoon showed 
credits and switched to another.<br>
Now I see what's happening and it scares me... That said, I don't enjoy it. If 
you do, that's fine with me.<br>
A friend of mine seems to still enjoy this for some reason. He may not mind 
the imagery, but I do ^^ Give me cute things.</p>

<h2 class="wt">The Fairly Odd Parents</h2>
<div class="info">1999?</div>
<small><p>(ey this is the first review i did for now)<br>
<br>
So, yeah, this is a cartoon about Timmy and his OddParents that was good at first seasons. I always watched it, it was fun, but... as it dragged on the seasons, it got worse.<br>
First off all, Poof is a stupid character. I don't know why they had to introduce him there, and I don't know either why they just had to keep him for so long. He was mostly a filler.<br>
Now, about the dog <s>[todo write name]</s> Sparky. Honestly, I liked him. I liked him more than the baby and the next character. He was good, but where did he go?<br>
The next character being some stupid girl <s>[todo write name]</s> named Chloe who managed to share Timmy's OddParents with her. I mean... why tho. The shortage is clearly a plot thing. Also, why exactly Timmy's ones? Couldn't they go for any other ones? Couldn't they just 'create' some new ones? Couldn't-- eh. What they did could be a way to make matters worse.<br>
And they really did. The fact that the annoying girl is treated in a better way than Timmy (whose fairies belong to), makes me wonder... why don't <i>his</i> OddParents take care more of him? Why is the annoying girl just annoying for no reason? Also, the cover in which Timmy's OddParents put more attention to the annoying one makes me sick. (later edit: It's like he's being betrayed by his own fairies)<br>
Honestly, the dog was a better character. They should have just kept the dog and have said the baby bye, but nooooo. They decided to make both dissapear and introduce an annoying character. The show couldn't get any worse from there.<br>
Also, in more later seasons, Timmy's fairies don't mind being seen around, and I think that's against what they were going for...<br>
Not to mention that in recent seasons, the quality seems to have gotten a bit worse, so... the show's ending (un)fortunately. I don't know what to say... It's gonna end having that annoying character <i>still</i> in.<br>
Also in recent seasons, Timmy's fairies having the power to teleport out of danger, yet not using it at the right time. They also began losing their wands for the plot, even tho in an episode I remember, Da Rules forbid it.<br>
<br>
It was fairly good in the beginning.<br>
<br>
And, yes, I said I like the dog. Yes, that fairy dog. fite me</p></small>

Also, there's a funny story about this.
Back in the day, when this show was airing, I didn't want to show it to my mom 
or watch it with her, I think because the monkey showed its butt or something. 
Then, many, many years later, I'm at cousin's house, with the cartoon playing, 
my mom came into the room and saw, and realized why I didn't show it to her. 
I don't know, this seemed kinda fun to me. My mom, the kind person she was, 
didn't do anything to me because of this, I don't think.<br>
I don't remember anything before, after, or in-between these events, 
I'm sorry...</p>

<p>It may seem weird, but I like this one.</p>
<small>2018-04-14</small>
<p>I still like it, don't understand the hate it gets.<br>
I think it's because people are used to the animesque Teen Titans and demand that this should be the same.<br>
It's not that, it's its own thing.<br>
But I also think the hate is because it was constantly airing for weeks for some reason...<br>
Still, that's not much of a reason to hate the show itself.</p>
