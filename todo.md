# TODO

### todo.md

* Figure out how `summary` and `details` work and apply them
  * Will be needed once this file grows

### sdig.html

* Continue the thing
* Replace 'XmYs' in embeds with seconds without 's'
* Make the table(s) in `summary` and `details`
  * May need a rewrite
* Stop using tables(?)

### wishlist.html

* Stop hotlinking the placeholder images
* Compress the images I added and host them somewhere else
  * Also, think of better names
* Don't use innerHTML
  * Also, the code could be better
* Separate the CSS and JS into different files
